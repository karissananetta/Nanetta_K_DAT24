This repository contains the final project for the Data Science class at General Assembly.

### My goal is to identify the trendsetters among Yelp users.

I define trendsetters to be users who leave their reviews early, have
huge social network, and review/frequent popular businesses.

I use the following method to identify the Yelp trendsetters:
I create new features that allow me to track the characteristics above on the user level,
and then I use k-means clustering to explore different types of Yelp
users. After that I visualize the result using matplotlib and Tableau, and then
identify the segments who are most likely to be trendsetters on Yelp.
